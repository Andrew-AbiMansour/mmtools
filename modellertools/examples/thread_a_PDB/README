DESCRIPTION

In this example, we will thread a new sequence onto the
Protein G structure.

2GB2_proG.seq        - a sequence file for the wildtype
2GB2_proG_mutWs.seq  - a sequence file for mutant

WT     MTYKLILNGKTLKGETTTEAVDAATAEKVFKQYANDNGVDGEWTYDDATKTFTVTE
mut    MTYKLILNGKTLKGETTTEAVDAATAEKVFKQYANDNGVDGEWTWDDATKTWTWTE

Close inspection shows that here we are mutating the hydrophobic
residues in the C-temrinal regions to tryptophans (a la trp-zip).
This is a good test of MODELLER's ability to re-pack interfaces.

To run the example:
$ python single_driver.py 2GB2_proG.pdb 2GB2_proG_mutWs.seq

This will output a threaded PDB file "target.pdb"
