This is an example of setting up a system for alchemical free energy calculation in gromacs via AMBER LEaP.

USAGE

PROCEDURE

* convert gromacs residue naming convention to AMBER and delete atoms not recognized by AMBER
* read ligand from .sdf or .mol2
* parameterize ligand for GAFF and AM1-BCC, producing .mol2 and frcmod files
* determine total charge on protein and ligand
* set up protein in LEaP, add ligand, add counterions, export to AMBER prmtop/crd
* convert AMBER to gromacs g96/top
* set ligand and any necessary counterions for neutralization to be annihilated in gromacs top
* setup solvent and complex simulations
